/*
  Multiple Serial test

  Receives from the main serial port, sends to the others.
  Receives from serial port 1, sends to the main serial (Serial 0).

  This example works only with boards with more than one serial like Arduino Mega, Due, Zero etc.

  The circuit:
  - any serial device attached to Serial port 1
  - Serial Monitor open on Serial port 0
